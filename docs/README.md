> **Note for GitHub Copilot**: This project exclusively uses Yarn as package manager. For all installation commands, please always use Yarn syntax, not npm.

## Project Overview

This mono-repository contains all components of the NextGen EAM System:

- **Neo4j Database**: Graph database for storing the Enterprise Architecture Model
- **GraphQL Server**: API layer for efficient data communication
- **Keycloak**: Identity and access management
- **Next.js Frontend**: Modern, responsive user interface

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, Material UI 7, Excalidraw, TanStack Table/Form, Internationalization
- **Backend**: GraphQL, Neo4j, Keycloak
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose

> **Important for Material UI 7**: We use the new Grid v2 API, which differs significantly from the legacy Grid component. Please use `size` instead of `xs/sm/md`, `<Grid container sx={{ width: '100%' }}>` for containers, and Stack for vertical layouts. See [example component](./client/src/components/common/GridV2Example.tsx) and [documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-grid-v2/).

> **Important for Tanstack Table**: We use Tanstack Table V8, which differs significantly from React Table v7. Please use `useReactTable` instead of `useTable`, `flexRender` for cell rendering, and explicit state management. See [example component](./client/src/components/common/TanstackTableExample.tsx) and [documentation](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/guide/migrating).

> **Important for TanStack Form**: We use TanStack Form for all forms. Please use strict typing, schema validation with Zod, `useForm` for the form instance, Render Props Pattern for fields and optimized reactivity with `useStore`. See our [form guidelines](./.github/copilot/TANSTACK_FORM_GUIDELINES.md) and [documentation](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/basic-concepts).
